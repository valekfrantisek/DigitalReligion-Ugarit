## Sources

The reconstruction has been based on the publication of French archaeologist Olivier Callot (Callot 2011). For a description of the temple, its archaeology, history and structure, see below.

## 3D Reconstruction

The model has been created using free and open source software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). The model itself is available in this repository, you can download it using this [link](https://github.com/valekfrantisek/DigitalReligion-Ugarit/blob/main/3DTempleOfBaal/Temple_of_Baal_blank.blend) for a blank model without any materials; or this [link](https://github.com/valekfrantisek/DigitalReligion-Ugarit/blob/main/3DTempleOfBaal/Temple_of_Baal_with_materials.blend) for model with embeded materials.

Materials and textures for the model were taken from [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/) repository. This repository is also open source and therefore freely reusable. However, these materials must remain only provisional, as they do not correspond with the ancient reality. More work is needed in order to create textures and materials that would better reflect the material reality of ancient Ugarit and the Eastern Mediterranean.

## Presentation of the model

This work has been presented at EASR 2023 in Vilnius (*20th Annual Conference of the European Association for the Study of Religions*) in presentation titled *Towards Visualizing Religion - Three Cases from Ancient Ugarit*.

## Description of the Temple of Baˁal

The following description has been taken from my dissertation on the religion at Ugarit (Válek 2023: 96-102). However, only basic references are included here.

So far, both the archaeological and textual evidence suggest that the most important cultic centre at Ugarit during the final phase of its existence was a large temple at the acropolis (see the plan above, TB) dedicated to Baˁal. This temple, together with the Temple/Terrace of Dagan, is so far the best explored and published, thanks to Callot (2011).

### Excavations and History
The Temple of Baˁal was unearthed during the first campaign in 1929 after Schaeffer moved from the port city in Minet el-Beida to the tell. The structure was at first not recognised as a temple but as a palace (Schaeffer 1929: 294-297).  However, the mistake was realised shortly afterwards and following reports refer to this structure as a temple. The excavations in the area of this temple continued until 1933. Only in 1975 a more detailed survey of the unearthed area was done. Thanks to it, some details that are now lost due to the disintegration of the structure are recorded. Systematic excavations continued from 1988 to 2005. For a more detailed summary of the history of excavations, see Callot (2011: 23-25).

History and development of the structure are difficult to establish (see Callot 2011: 60-64). There seem to be two main architectural phases, both of which ended in destruction. Construction of the first dates back to the 19th/18th century BC. The second phase utilised the foundations of the first, which allows us to reconstruct the outline of the first phase. The same cannot be said about the annexes which were possibly part of the temple precinct only during the final phase. The beginning of the construction of the second phase dates to the reign of ˁAmmiṯtamru III, after 1250, when Ugarit was presumably hit by a strong earthquake and the temples at the acropolis were damaged and needed reconstruction.  The reconstruction seems to have been total, except for the foundations and continued with the following kings of Ugarit. The second phase came to an end together with the city at the beginning of the 12th century BC. The archaeological evidence from the 2nd phase is complemented with abundant textual material. 

### Structure and Reconstruction

Because the structure of the first phase eludes us almost completely, we will focus on the structure of the temple during the second phase after its reconstruction. Both were probably quite similar.

#### Temple

(For more details and references, see Callot 2011: 39-48 or Yon 2006: 106-110.)

As stated above, the plan of the temple (see below) itself was based on previous foundations. On the exterior, the temple is ca. 22 m long and 16,5 m wide, and its entrance is facing south (slightly to the east). The foundations were made of stone, using ashlar stones on corners and burdened parts. The width of the foundation walls is ca. 1,65 m on average, varying only slightly.

While reconstructing the structure above the foundations is a challenging and speculative task, and we must bear in mind that the final reconstruction is only an approximation based on scattered evidence, there is a reason to undertake such an endeavour. The architecture of this monument may help us to understand its functioning and its proper place within the city.

The ground floor was divided into two main parts – the southern (vestibule) and the northern (cella) sectors (following Yon 2006: 109).  Inner dimensions of the vestibule are ca. 8,5 x 6,5 m. The vestibule was accessible from the courtyard through five steps made of large stone blocks leading to an over 5 m wide entrance. At the entrance, there were two wooden columns which supported its architrave. From the vestibule, a port of ca. 2,75 m was leading to the cella, whose floor was probably situated a bit higher than that of the vestibule.

The cella was, at least according to the remains, more complex than the vestibule. The large room (ca. 13,2 x 8,25 m) was divided alongside the east-west axis by three columns which supported the upper structure. It seems probable that the columns were not destined only to support the upper floors, but the division of internal space was intentional – it was the space behind these columns where we suspect the innermost sanctuary was located and where the access was the most restricted. In the eastern part of the cella was a wooden staircase leading to the upper floors.

Callot reconstructs three upper levels of the temple. While the presence of upper floors seems quite probable, and this temple was most likely a “temple tower” – based on available texts, the presence of the staircase, or clay models of temples/houses from northern Syria – the exact reconstruction is speculative. The height of the temple is estimated to be between eighteen and twenty meters. Since the acropolis of the tell was some twenty meters above the surroundings and about 30 meters above sea level, the temple towered very high. It has been suggested that it might have functioned as a kind of lighthouse or landmark for the sailors whose relationship to the temple and its deity is supported by rich finds of votive anchors discovered in the temple precinct (see Schaeffer de Chalon & Schaeffer-Boehling 1978: 371-381). The temple was probably constructed similarly to the domestic architecture at Ugarit (see, e.g., Callot 1983, Yon, Lombard & Reniso 1987, or Callot 1994) – using wooden armature and fillings of stone.

#### Courtyards

(For more details and references, see Callot 2011: 37-39.)

The temple was accessed through a portal from the main courtyard (“court A” in fig. below). The main courtyard was slightly irregular in shape and measured ca. 11,55–13,75 x 12,1 m. The main access from the city to it was probably through a large gate on its western side. However, there was also an entrance from the western annexes. One may guess that the main entrance was used during feasts and festivals, while the entrance from the annexes was used by cultic personnel for daily service (Callot 2011: 55).  In front of the temple entrance was an altar, which was well-preserved when it was discovered but is now unfortunately destroyed, and its remains are scattered in the courtyard. The altar was square-shaped, with an edge of ca. 2,2 m, and two steps from the south lead to its top. In total, the altar might have been slightly more than 0,5 m in height.

The eastern part of the main court was probably isolated from the second courtyard (“court B” in fig. 17) by a wooden fence, of which only a small part of support remains. This walled courtyard was no more than 6 m wide in its widest part, and it was stretched alongside the temple. It was probably of auxiliary importance, used, for example, for gathering animals before sacrifices, but this remains speculative (Callot 2011: 56).  In its southeast corner, there might have been an additional entrance through which the sacrificial animals were brought in.

#### Annexes

(For more details and references, see Callot 2011: 36-39 and 55.)

There are two annexed buildings which seem to be connected directly to the temple precinct. We have already mentioned the western annexes from which there was access to the main courtyard. These annexes consisted of three rooms and were possibly used by cultic personnel. In the southeast corner of the main courtyard, there was a second annexe, which is unfortunately severely damaged, and even its interpretation as an annexe to the temple is not without difficulties.

#### Access

(For more details and references, see Callot 2011: 36-37.)

The temple precinct was probably accessible through three entrances. The main gate was connected to the street leading west to the Royal Palace (RP in the plan). This street was rather steep in its final part and finished in a stairway. The main gate itself included several stairs. The second access was through the western annexes, which were also accessible through the street leading to the palace. The third entrance was probably located on the east, leading to the second courtyard. Coming from the palace, one might have continued east along the southern wall of the temple precinct to a street leading to the Temple/Terrace of Dagan along the House of the High Priest (so-called Rue de la bibliothéque) or north along the wall of the western annexes to the Lower City.

### Dedication to Baˁal

So far, we have taken the designation of the Temple of Baˁal for granted, but at least a short discussion on the identification of the principal inhabitant of this temple seems appropriate. The first part of the [Stela of Mami](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010137899) has already been discovered during the first campaign, and the deity was shortly afterwards identified as Seth/Baˁal of Ṣapan, which has led to initial identification of the city as Ṣapan (see Schaeffer 1931: 10), a mistake that has been realised in shortly afterwards (see Schaeffer 1932: 24-27).  Hand in hand with other numerous Egyptian/Egyptianizing discoveries, the structure was firstly designated as “temple égyptien”, “quartier égyptien”, or “salle égyptienne”  then simply “temple” or “grand temple”  when finally, its attribution to Baˁal came in 1934 (Schaeffer 1935: 155).

There are two basic reasons for this identification. Firstly, several stelae (e.g., [Baˁal au Foudre](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010140542) or the above-mentioned [Stela of Mami](https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010137899)) and figures depicting Baˁal  were discovered either in the temple precinct or its vicinity.  Second, Ugaritic texts testify to the presence of a temple of Baˁal at Ugarit,  and some of them include feeble descriptive hints that may correspond to the archaeological material such as the presence of the tower. In addition, Baˁal was also the most prominent deity at Ugarit, both in cult and in narratives, which makes the attribution of the most prominent temple to him very plausible.
